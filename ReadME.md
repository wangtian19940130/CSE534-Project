This project contains 3 parts:

1. Bandwidth test with different ACK frequencies.

2. Bandwidth test with different TCP congestion algorithms.

3. Bandwidth test on TCP-TACK mechanism. 

Attention that only if you correctly install Mininet-wifi, you can run the test scripts and see the results.

Detailed explanation can be found in sub-folders.

Some test are done with python scripts. Some are done with Mininet command lines. You can found them in these folders and some test results run by us.

Attention that only if you follow our instructions, though a little complicated, you can run the tests successfully. 

Contact us with email if there is any problem.
